# Sonification Plugin Library
This plugin library hosts the sonification plugins for CODAP. [Sonification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification) utilizes sound to represent data (instead of visuals). There are many types of sonification such as a multidimensional scatter plot that emits sounds instead of visual dots, a picture scanned into gradually changing sounds, and an immersive spatial audio that represents the planetary motions.

CODAP does not do picture scanning or spatial audio (yet), but it offers a lot of other simple sonification plugins that you can flexibly combine for data exploration, storytelling, and even composing music.

To get started, click the first item of this plugin (**Simple Spectrum**) and follow the instructions there by pressing the "?" button.

# Case Sequencer
This is a utility plugin for sonification that controls the selection of cases / groups. It does not produce sounds by itself, but can animate other plugin's sounds such as Simple Spectrum.

## Basic Usage
- This plugin needs to focus on a collection (i.e., a group hierarchy) of the target data context. Select a collection in the dropdown menu or drag-drop an attribute belonging to the collection.
- Sort an attribute in the table to set the order of the sequence.
- Press Play to start the dynamic selections. You may want to minimize the table or graphs during the playback since they can slow down with big data.
- You can also manually scan / select the data by moving the Position slider (while it's not playing).

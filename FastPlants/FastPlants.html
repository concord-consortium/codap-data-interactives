<!--
With nothing checked, all growth curves (height vs day) are smooth.

As soon as a plant gets height > 0.5 it acquires two leaves. Each day, the number of leaves increases by 1 or 2.
The number of leaves stops increasing after 1.5 * the halfway number of days which is around 10, but varies from plant
to plant.

The light effect causes
plants in shade are on average 6 units taller. Plants in shade will 70% of the time increase their number of leaves
by 1 instead of two, whereas for plants in sun, it happens only 40% of the time. DaysToFlower is about two days greater
for plants in the shade.
plants in sun grow a bit faster to their maximum and their “middle day” is on average 2 days sooner than those
in shade.

Noisy Growth affects only the plant growth, not the leaves or flowers. Each day it adds a normally distributed growth
with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 2. However, this ‘noise" is not allowed to shrink the plant from its
previous height.

Shrinkage in Last Days affects only the height and only in the last three days. It subtracts from the plant’s height
a normally distributed amount with a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5 (but with a floor of zero).

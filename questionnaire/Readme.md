### Questionnaire

This is a data interactive to present a questionnaire and insert the 
results as a sequence of CODAP data items.

The underlying technology is [survey.js](http://surveyjs.org/) It 
provides a means of designing a questionnaire, outputting a JSON document.

The present implementation supports the Learning Everywhere project
and can work with the Ant Picnic data set, but it could be generalized 
without much difficulty.

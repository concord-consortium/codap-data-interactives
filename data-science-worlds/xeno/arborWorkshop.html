<h1>Trees in a Diagnosis Game</h1>

<p>To begin, simplify the screen: minimize the <b>diagnostic tree</b> window
    by pressing the minus sign in its title bar.
    Move it away so you're not distracted by it; we'll get to it later.</p>

<p style="background-color: #aaccbb; padding : 12px;"><b>Scenario</b>:
    You're a xenobiologist studying alien creatures.
    Sometimes they get sick. At the beginning of our tale, you have records for 10 creatures, some of whom were
    suffering from <i>ague</i> (an alien disease).
    What is it about the creatures that makes them susceptible to ague?
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Starting with the Arbor Xenobiological Services panel in Training mode, explore the data you already have&mdash;10 cases&mdash;to
        see if you can figure out what "predicts" the disease (in this case, ague).
        <ul>
            <li>
                In the "creatures" data table, the <b>health</b> column tells you if they are sick or well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Figure out what <i>other</i> data you can use to predict <b>health</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Making a graph of the data might help. A lot. (This is CODAP, after all!)
                If you have never made a graph in CODAP before, try
                <a href="http://codap.concord.org/releases/latest/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=32840" target="_blank">this</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="art/arborControls.png" width="333">
    <li>Get additional cases to confirm your ideas.
        Do this by pressing <b>make new cases</b>
        in the little panel
        on the right side of <b>Arbor Xenobiological Services</b>.
    </li>
    <li>When you're confident, change the left-hand choice to <b>one by one</b>.
    <li>Now you will diagnose individual cases. See if you're right.
        If you're not consistently right, review your data
        and see what you might have missed.
        (Notice that you're gaining points!)
    <li>When you think you have this figured out, we will automate the process of diagnosing these creatures.
        See the next section on using trees for diagnosis.
</ul>

<h1>Trees for Diagnosis</h1>
<p>
    To diagnose a patient, we ask a sequence of questions.
    The answers will help us predict whether creatures have this sickness.
    The answer to a question leads either to a diagnosis (sick or well) or to a further question.
    We will represent&mdash;and automate&mdash;this process using the diagnostic tree.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expand the diagnostic tree by pressing that minus sign again.
    <li>Arrange your screen so you can see it. (You might want to make your data table smaller.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagnostic tree should look like the next picture, except that your numbers will be different.</p>

<img src="art/treeRootOnlyBeginnning.png" width="333">

<p>Grow your tree by dragging attribute names from the palette of names (at the bottom of the window) to the box.
    You probably already figured out which attribute is important.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Drag <b>hair</b> from the palette to the box.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You should see this:</p>

<img src="art/treeOneSplitHairNoDiag.png" width="333">

<p>Here's what it means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the top box (in the illustration; your numbers will be different). Among all of the creatures, 5 out of 10 (50%) are sick.
    <li>Our first "question" is, what color hair does the patient have? (That's why <b>hair?</b> is in the bottom
        stripe).
    <li>There are two possible answers, <b>blue</b> and <b>pink</b>. Each one leads to a different box.
    <li>The left-hand box tells us that there are 5 creatures with blue hair, and none of them (0%) are sick.
    <li>The right-hand box tells us that there are 5 creatures with pink hair, and all 5 of them (100%) are sick.
</ul>

<p>Note: You can also "hover" over any box or link in the diagnostic tree to get more information.</p>

<h2>Positive and Negative</h2>

<p>Often, medical specialists talk about "positive" and "negative" diagnoses and results.
    With our tree tool, we will think of "sick" as <i>positive</i>, like a positive test for ague.
    To predict which creatures have ague, we will label them as positive.</p>

<h2>Automation</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to automate our diagnoses.
    We have to tell the tree to assign the pink-hair box to the positive ("sick") group
    and the blue-hair box to the negative ("well") group.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Click the box at the top for <b>show diagnosis "leaves."</b> You will see this:
    </li>
</ul>
<img src="art/treeOneSplitDiagNoAssignments.png" width="333">


<p>The gray circles with <b>(?)</b> indicate that you have not yet assigned diagnoses to those boxes. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Click them to assign diagnoses. Make it so it looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<img src="art/treeOneSplitDiagGood.png" width="333">
<p>
    When you have your tree set the way you want it, go back to <b>Arbor Xenobiological Services</b> and choose
    <b>auto</b> on the left.
    Then click the <b>run tree</b> button to create 10 cases.</p>
<img src="art/automate.png" width="333">
<p>Your diagnostic tree will automatically diagnose 10 new patients. How did your tree do?</p>

<h2>Explore</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If you haven't already, make graphs of the data to show why your diagnosis works.</li>
    <li>Click a case in the data table or in a graph. See how it is reflected in the tree.
    <li>Click one of the bottom boxes in the tree. See how it is reflected in the table and in any graphs.
    <li>Try making some bad trees, or make bigger trees, and see how they work.
    <li>Figure out what affects your score.
    <li>Try other scenarios. They're harder.
        (When you choose one, your old data will disappear. And you'll have to configure variables. See below.)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuring Variables</h2>
<p>
    You will find, as you work through harder scenarios,
    that you will want your question to be different from what the default situation allows.
    For example, suppose you want to ask about <b>weight</b>.
    Since each question is <em>binary</em>, you can only ask if the weight is above or below some number.
    But what number?
</p>
<img src="art/showGearButton.png" width="144">
<p>
    You need to <em>configure</em> the attribute. When you hover over its name in the tree,
    you will see a gear button appear to the left.</p>
<img src="art/gear.png" width="333">

 <p>   Click it to get the configuration dialog.

</p>
<img src="art/configurationWeight.png" width="333">

<ul>
    <li> For a numeric attribute, you can set the "cutoff point."</li>
    <li> For a numeric attribute, you can set the operator, that is, greater than or less than.</li>
    <li> For a categorical attribute, click the possible values to move them left and right.</li>
    <li> For any attribute, click the left-right button to swap the left and right values.</li>
    <li> For any attribute, change the labels to be something meaningful. For example, for <b>weight</b>,
        you might use <em>heavy</em> and <em>light</em>.
    </li>
</ul>

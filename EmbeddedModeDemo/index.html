    <h1>An Exploration of Sampling</h1>
    <p>At left is a sampler. Press its <em>Run</em> button to see it work.</p>
    <p>It mixes the labeled balls and chooses or <em>draws</em>, one at a time at random.
        After the ball's label is recorded, the ball returns to the mix.</p>
    <p>After the sampler has drawn two balls, it puts the results in a data set.
        You can see a table of the data by pressing this button:
        <button id="addTableButton">Add Table</button>
    </p>
    <p>Press the <em>Run</em> button again and watch the draws added to the table.</p>
    <p>Notice that each time you press Run, you get a new <em>experiment</em>. And each experiment has as many runs
        as there are repetitions.</p>
    <p>The rightmost portion of the table keeps track of the <em>draws</em>.</p>
    <p>To make a graph of the Draws, press this button:
        <button id="addGraphButton">Add Graph</button>
    </p>
    <p>Any time you want to remove all the data, press this button: <button id="clearDataButton">Clear Data</button></p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Explain the relationship between the labelled balls and the graph of <em>values</em>.
        <input type="text" size="100"/></li>
        <li>Drag <em>combinations</em> from the table to the graph's x-axis. Which combination appears most frequently? Why?
        <input type="text" size="100"></li>
